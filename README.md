# Page-Visibility-API-w-Kaltura-Player

A player plugin that uses the page visibility API to detect if the player is on a webpage that is in full view.

This is based on: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API

We want to add support for detecting if the parent container of the player is in full view of the browser window, but have yet to implement that.
